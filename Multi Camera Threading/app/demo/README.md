The application is designed in such a way that it runs an ML model in Multi-Camera to detect the car and track the specified object in the Django framework. Use the “setting.json” file to add the camera path and ml models to respective dictionary keys.

Each “Streaming()” object is initiated using threading and for each camera, certain weights have been loaded via the “setting.json” file.
